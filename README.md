              Welcome to the WhatsApp Web Packet Analysis project repository! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing packets from WhatsApp web group messages. The project involves sniffing packets, identifying message-related packets, and generating helpful plots to facilitate packet identification. The analysis is conducted in two distinct parts: one involving packet filtering, and the other simulating real-world noise with YouTube music playing in the background.

Introduction
The goal of the WhatsApp Web Packet Analysis project is to dissect and interpret packets generated by WhatsApp web group messages. By applying various analysis techniques and filtering methods, the project aims to identify packets that correspond to sent messages. Visualization plots are employed to assist in the identification process.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three main directories:

res: This directory houses the plots generated during the analysis, including plots depicting functions of time as functions of packet size, PDF (probability density function) plots, and CCDF (Complementary CDF) plots.
resources: This directory contains eight pcapng files and, eight CSV files, with four corresponding to filtered packets and four to unfiltered packets. These resources serve as the basis for the analysis.
src: Within this directory, you'll find four Python files. Each file contains code for a different type of plot: the CCDF plot, the PDF plot, and the time as a function of the size plot.
Packet Analysis
Part 1: With Filtering
In this phase, the packet analysis is conducted while applying a filter specifically targeting tcp.port 443. This filtering helps reduce noise and concentrate on the most pertinent packets. The focus is on isolating the packets associated with the sent messages and creating visualization plots to aid in their identification.

Part 2: Without Filtering and Background Music
The second phase of the analysis is conducted without any packet filtering, and it introduces a realistic element of background noise. The simulated background noise is akin to having YouTube music playing in the background. The objective here is to assess real-world noise's impact on packet analysis accuracy.

Plots
The res directory hosts a variety of plots that provide valuable insights into the packet analysis process:

Functions of Time vs. Packet Size: These plots showcase the relationship between time and packet size, shedding light on trends and patterns.
PDF (Probability Density Function) Plots: PDF plots graphically represent the probability distribution of packet sizes. Separate plots are generated for each packet, totaling eight plots (four filtered and four unfiltered).
CCDF (Complementary CDF) Plots: CCDF plots illustrate the complementary cumulative distribution function of packet sizes. CCDF plots are generated for the four filtered packets.
Resources
The resources directory encompasses the raw materials necessary for the analysis, consisting of eight CSV files representing both filtered and unfiltered packets.

Source Code
The src directory contains the Python code required for generating different types of plots. The four Python files are dedicated to the CCDF plot, the PDF plots, and the time as a function of the size plot.

ChatGPT
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the exploration of WhatsApp Web Packet Analysis! Inside this repository, you will discover a collection of code and assets aimed at dissecting packets from group messages on WhatsApp's web platform. This endeavor involves capturing packets, recognizing those linked to messages, and generating informative visual representations to facilitate packet discernment. The investigation unfolds in two distinctive phases: one encompassing packet sifting, while the other introduces an authentic layer of ambient interference via the harmonies of YouTube melodies in the backdrop.

Introduction
The mission of the WhatsApp Web Packet Analysis project revolves around the dissection and interpretation of packets stemming from group messages on WhatsApp's web interface. By applying a multitude of analytical methodologies and filtration techniques, the project strives to pinpoint packets corresponding to dispatched messages. Visual representations in the form of graphical depictions are harnessed to assist in this process of identification.

Structure of the Project
The project has been systematically arranged into three primary directories:

res: This repository houses the graphical representations generated throughout the analysis journey. These include depictions that illustrate temporal trends concerning packet sizes, graphs portraying the probability density function (PDF) of packet sizes, and plots that elucidate the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of packet sizes.
resources: Within this section, eight pcapng files and eight CSV files are contained, with four tailored to filtered packets and the other four addressing unfiltered packets. These resources serve as the foundation for the comprehensive analysis.
src: Nested in this directory are four Python scripts. Each script is crafted to produce a distinct variety of graphical representation: CCDF plots, PDF plots, and plots that illustrate the interplay between time and size of packets.
Analysis of Packets
Segment 1: Incorporating Filters
During this phase, the scrutiny of packets is executed with precision via a filter that is laser-focused on tcp.port 443. This particular filter is instrumental in minimizing extraneous noise, honing in on the most pertinent packets. The objective is to isolate packets linked to dispatched messages and craft visual plots that expedite their identification.

Segment 2: Devoid of Filters and Accompanied by Ambient Music
The second segment of analysis transpires without the application of packet filters. Instead, it introduces a layer of authenticity by simulating real-world background noise. This auditory backdrop echoes the experience of having YouTube music playing while conducting the analysis. The key goal here is to assess how real-world noise influences the accuracy of packet analysis.

Visual Depictions
Contained within the res directory are an array of graphical portrayals that furnish profound insights into the process of packet analysis:

Temporal Trends vs. Packet Size: These graphical representations cast a spotlight on the interplay between time and packet size, unveiling patterns and tendencies.
Plots of Probability Density Function (PDF): PDF plots offer a graphical depiction of the probability distribution pertaining to packet sizes. A total of eight plots are generated, encompassing both filtered and unfiltered packets.
Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) Plots: The CCDF plots provide a visual representation of the complementary cumulative distribution function of packet sizes. These plots exclusively address the four packets that have undergone filtration.
Resource Pool
The resources directory serves as the repository of foundational materials indispensable for conducting the analysis. It encompasses eight CSV files that encapsulate both filtered and unfiltered packets.

Code Source
Within the src directory, you will encounter the Python code indispensable for generating diverse graphical representations. The four Python scripts are dedicated to crafting CCDF plots, PDF plots, and plots that illustrate the correlation between time and packet size.
